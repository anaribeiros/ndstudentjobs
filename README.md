# Notre Dame Student Jobs scraper

**Goal:** Scrape all student jobs from ND's Job Board, organizing them and their compensations concisely in one Google Sheet.

**Why?** 
  * As a broke college student, it's honestly annoying to have to click on multiple pages just to find out what job fits me the best (and pays me the most!)
  * So, I felt it'd be nice to just run this script and have everything stored on a spreadsheet (so much faster to read/go through, especially when there are 20+ listed jobs at the start of each semester).

**What I've used**
*   Beautiful Soup: to scrape data out of ND's Job Board
*   Pandas: to create/manipulate a dataframe w/ job information
*   Gspread: to access and edit a Google Sheet
